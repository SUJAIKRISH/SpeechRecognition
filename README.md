# SpeechRecognition - Voice-Controlled Assistant

Welcome to the SpeechRecognition project, a voice-controlled assistant inspired by the AI assistant in the Iron Man movie, Jarvis. This project leverages speech recognition technology to answer questions and open desired applications on your PC, providing a hands-free and interactive computing experience through voice commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- The following Python modules:
  - pyjokes
  - pyttsx3
  - speech_recognition
  - datetime
  - wikipedia
  - webbrowser
  - os
  - smtplib (for email functionality)

You can install these modules using pip:

```bash
pip install pyjokes pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition datetime wikipedia
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kunal-kawate/SpeechRecognition.git
   ```

   cd SpeechRecognition
   ```

3. Run the `speech_recognition.py` script:

   ```bash
   python speech_recognition.py
